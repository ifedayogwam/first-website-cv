  <!-- This section shows why you should not use html to design your website  -->
  <!-- When using html to do things other than structure you tend to use complex nested tags, meaning a tag within a tag and that kind of work gets complex fast -->
  <!-- This is an explanation of how the skills section in my website is done -->
  <h3> SKILLS </h3>
  <!-- The table tag with cellspacing is a function to ensure all the things nested in follow the instruction of having a spacing between cellls or you can call them rows, even though the lines are not drawn  -->
  <!-- For an easy approach to this probkem you make the skills and stars seperately first and make sure you can see them all in a straight line  -->
  <!-- The end of the generic table section section with running and playing football or the one with solving math and logical analysis should be done first (skills and stars)  -->
  <!-- You then create the master tr which starts after cellspacing stuff(master table tag) and ends before the end of the master table tag -->
  <!-- This contains 2 td's as you can see there are two different sections with skills and stars -->
  <!-- Your seperately made skills and stars sections are then nested in the td's and that is how you achieve what you see on my skills section -->
